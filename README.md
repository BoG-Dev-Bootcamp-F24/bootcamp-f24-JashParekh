Instructions
1. Install Git
Git is a developer tool used to track file changes and much more.

Mac
Open the Terminal app via Spotlight search
Check if you have Git installed already by typing the command git
If you get a prompt asking "Would you like to install the tools now?" (Xcode Dev tools), selected Install
If you see a list of common Git commands, continue to the next step
Configure your Git username by typing the command git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Configure your Git email by typing the command git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com" (Typically this is the email you will use to sign up for GitHub)
Congrats you installed Git!
Windows
Visit https://git-scm.com and download the Windows Installer
Open the Windows Installer on your computer and go through the prompts
Open GitBash
Configure your Git username by typing the command git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Configure your Git email by typing the command git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com" (Typically this is the email you will use to sign up for GitHub)
Congrats you installed Git!
2. Create a GitHub Account
A GitHub account will allow you to be added to the GitHub organization, so you can pull and push to repos and work on your projects collaboratively.

Go to https://github.com and Sign up to create an account or Log in if you already have one
Create a username and password
Verify an email
Send a message in the gt-bootcamp-dev Slack channel with your GitHub username, and an instructor will add you to the organization
Accept the invite to the GitHub Organization in your email
3. Install Node
Node is a version of Javascript that can run on the server. We will use this in both frontend and backend development. Installing Node also installs NPM (Node Package Manager) for us. We will talk more about these two things later.

Download and open the LTS release of Node from https://nodejs.org/en/
In Terminal or GitBash, check if node is installed by entering the command node -v
if the output looks something like v18.17.1, it has been successfully installed
4. Install Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is the code editor of choice for web developers since it has lots of helpful extensions and autocomplete features.

Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Learn more about what extensions might be useful in the Bootcamp Curriculum here
5. React Developer Tools Extension
This chrome extension adds React debugging tools to Chrome Dev Tools.

Add and install the extension here
6. Install Homebrew (Mac users only)
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. Sometimes it makes it easier to install certain things like Node or Git. This is totally optional, but I do recommend it for mac programmers.

Visit https://brew.sh and copy the command to install Homebrew
Open Terminal and paste the command that was just copied
